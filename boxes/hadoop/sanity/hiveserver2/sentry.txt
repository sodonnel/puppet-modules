# Enable

To enable on this VM do the following:

1) Uncomment the sentry section from hdfs-site.xml and hive-site.xml

2) service sentry-store start

3) Restart services:

service hadoop-hdfs-namenode restart
service hive-metastore restart
service hive-server2 restart

4) Set the permissions on the hive warehouse directory:

hadoop fs -chown -R hive:hive /user/hive/warehouse
hadoop fs -chmod -R 771 /user/hive/warehouse

# Create an admin group

Hive is configured as an admin group, so get a hive ticket and then connect to beeline:

    kinit -kt /etc/hive/conf/hive.keytab hive/standalone
    beeline
    !connect jdbc:hive2://standalone:10000/default;principal=hive/standalone@EXAMPLE.COM


create role admin
grant all on server server1 to role admin;
grant admin to group hive;

Now when you connect as Hive you can do just about anything.

# Useful commands

SHOW ROLES
SHOW CURRENT ROLES
SHOW ROLE GRANT GROUP group_name
SHOW GRANT ROLE role_name

Grant to SERVER, DATABASE, TABLE, COLUMN.

You can grant ALL, SELECT, INSERT.

Create a table in DB - need all on DATABASE I think.

To read any table in a DB, grant select on database xxx to role xxx
