To test hiveserver2 is working correctly, connect using beeline, then issue a connect statement:

    !connect jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000

Then try listing tables or running a select.

To connect to a secured cluster:

    !connect jdbc:hive2://standalone:10000/default;principal=hive/standalone@EXAMPLE.COM

Notice that the principal in the connection string is the principal of the hive2server. You need a kinit ticket before connecting
