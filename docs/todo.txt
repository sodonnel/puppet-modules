* Namenode - VM uses 2 network interfaces. Should I pass the IP along with the hostname or can I use the factr IP address?

* Secondary Namenode and multiple namenode data directories

* Notify datanode and yarn-nodemanager services if config changes

* Move the YARN HDFS checks into resource manager instead of running on each datanode

One host in the cluster:





mapreduce-historyserver hadoop-yarn-proxyserver

Resource manager:

hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager


all nodes except resource manager:

 hadoop-yarn-nodemanager hadoop-hdfs-datanode hadoop-mapreduce
